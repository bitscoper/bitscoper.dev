title: "CPU-bound vs. GPU-bound Games"
---

CPU-bound and GPU-bound games describe how different types of games rely more heavily on either the central processing unit (CPU) or the graphics processing unit (GPU) for performance.

## CPU-bound Games

### Definition

CPU-bound games rely primarily on the CPU, which handles complex calculations, game logic, artificial intelligence, and physics simulations.

### Characteristics

- Heavy dependence on game logic, AI routines, and physics calculations
- Often benefit from higher clock speeds and multiple CPU cores
- Less sensitive to GPU performance once a basic graphics threshold is met
- Limited performance gains from advanced GPU features

## GPU-bound Games

### Definition

GPU-bound games rely mainly on the GPU, taking advantage of its massively parallel architecture to handle rendering and visual computations.

### Characteristics

- High reliance on GPU-intensive tasks such as 3D rendering, texture mapping, and lighting
- Optimized to utilize multiple shader cores
- Significant performance gains from modern GPU features like rasterization, ray tracing, and AI-based upscaling

## Why the Difference Matters

### Performance

- CPU-bound games perform better with faster or higher-core-count CPUs (for example, Intel Core or AMD Ryzen processors).
- GPU-bound games require powerful GPUs to maintain high frame rates and smooth gameplay.

### Visual Experience

GPU-bound games typically offer superior visual quality, especially in modern titles that use advanced lighting, ray tracing, and AI-enhanced graphical effects.
