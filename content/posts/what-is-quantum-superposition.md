title: "What Is Quantum Superposition?"
---

Quantum superposition is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that arises from the linearity of the Schrödinger equation. This principle allows **quantum states to be expressed as superpositions of eigenfunctions**, ensuring that such combinations are themselves valid solutions.

In quantum computing, **qubits** are the quantum analog of classical bits and can exist in a **superposition of states**. Unlike classical bits, which represent information in a single, definite state at any given time, qubits can represent multiple states simultaneously.

However, maintaining and controlling quantum superposition is a major technical challenge. Systems such as nuclear spins exhibit weak coupling, which makes them highly resistant to external disturbances. While this robustness improves stability, it also complicates precise control and accurate readout of quantum states.
