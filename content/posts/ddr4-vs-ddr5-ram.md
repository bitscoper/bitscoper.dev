title: "DDR4 vs. DDR5 RAM"
---

DDR4 and DDR5 are successive generations of system memory, with DDR5 introducing improvements in bandwidth, power efficiency, and capacity to meet the demands of modern computing workloads.

## Memory Bandwidth

One of the primary differences between DDR4 and DDR5 RAM is memory speed. DDR4 is commonly capped at an effective data rate of **3200 MT/s** (up from its original 2133 MT/s). In contrast, DDR5 starts at **4800 MT/s** and can reach **6400 MT/s** or higher.

Memory manufacturers are already producing modules operating at **8000 MT/s and beyond**, offering significantly increased bandwidth for high-performance applications.

## Voltage and Power Efficiency

DDR4 operates at a nominal voltage of **1.2 V**, while DDR5 reduces this to **1.1 V**. DDR5 achieves improved power regulation by integrating **Power Management Integrated Circuits (PMICs)** directly onto each memory module.

While the lower voltage improves power efficiency and signal stability, the on-module PMICs can generate additional localized heat. As a result, effective thermal design and adequate cooling become more important for high-speed DDR5 modules.

## Capacity

DDR4 memory modules are typically limited to **32 GB per DIMM**, with only select high-density kits reaching this capacity. DDR5 significantly increases memory density, supporting up to **128 GB per DIMM**.

This increased capacity enables better performance in memory-intensive workloads such as content creation, virtualization, and large-scale gaming environments.

## Summary

DDR5 offers substantial improvements over DDR4 in bandwidth, power management, and maximum capacity, making it better suited for modern and future computing platforms. However, real-world performance gains depend on platform support, workload characteristics, and memory configuration.
