title: "Types of Coupling in Crosstalk"
---

Crosstalk is primarily caused by **coupling between adjacent signal paths**, typically parallel conductors or cables. This coupling arises from **electrostatic or electromagnetic interactions**, resulting in unintended interference signals. The main coupling mechanisms are described below.

### 1. Capacitive Coupling (Electrostatic Coupling)

Capacitive coupling occurs when the **electric field** generated by a voltage on one conductor induces an unwanted signal on a nearby parallel conductor. This effect is caused by the **parasitic capacitance** that exists between closely spaced conductors.

The resulting interference is known as **capacitive crosstalk** and is more pronounced at **high frequencies** and in circuits with high impedance.

### 2. Inductive Coupling (Electromagnetic Coupling)

Inductive coupling occurs when a **time-varying current** in one conductor generates a changing magnetic field that induces a voltage in a nearby conductor through **mutual inductance**.

This form of interference is referred to as **inductive crosstalk** and is typically influenced by current magnitude, signal frequency, and loop area.
