---

When selecting between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi for your home network, consider the following factors:

### Speed and Performance

- **2.4 GHz**: Offers **slower speeds** (up to ~300 Mbps) due to its **wider frequency band**.
- **5 GHz**: Provides **faster speeds** (up to 1200 Mbps or more) with **less congestion**, ideal for high-bandwidth activities like streaming and gaming.

### Coverage and Obstacle Penetration

- **2.4 GHz**: Excels in **broader coverage** and **can penetrate through walls**, making it suitable for large homes or areas with many obstacles.
- **5 GHz**: Has a **shorter range** and **struggles to penetrate through walls**, which may limit its effectiveness in obstructed environments.

### Device Compatibility

- **2.4 GHz**: Compatible with almost all devices, including older models and IoT devices.
- **5 GHz**: Supported by most modern devices but may not work with some older or specific IoT devices.

### Interference

- **2.4 GHz**: More prone to interference from unregulated devices like microwaves and Bluetooth.
- **5 GHz**: Less susceptible to interference, offering a more stable connection.

Choose 2.4 GHz for **broader coverage** and **older devices in large or obstructed spaces**. Opt for 5 GHz if you prioritize **faster speeds** and have **modern devices in an open environment with fewer obstructions**. For optimal performance, consider using **both bands** with a mesh network setup.
