title: "Fedora Asahi Remix Brings Gaming to Apple Silicon"
---

Fedora has announced a significant update to **Fedora Asahi Remix**, a Linux-based operating system tailored for Apple Silicon Macs. This update expands gaming support on ARM-based systems by introducing modern graphics APIs and improved compatibility layers.

## Expanded Graphics and Gaming Support

Fedora Asahi Remix now supports:

- **Vulkan 1.3**
- **OpenGL 4.6**
- **Wine** for running Windows games

These additions enable a broader range of native and non-native games to run on Apple Silicon hardware.

## x86 Emulation and Game Compatibility

With x86 emulation, Fedora Asahi Remix allows many non-native titles—including some AAA games—to run smoothly on ARM-based Macs. This significantly lowers the barrier for gaming on Apple Silicon devices, which have traditionally faced limited support.

## Ongoing Development

Although still under active development, Fedora plans to continue improving Fedora Asahi Remix with a strong focus on expanding ARM gaming capabilities and performance optimization.
