Cyber attacks have become increasingly common in the modern world, and they can have serious consequences for individuals, businesses, and even governments. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the biggest cyber attacks in history, including how they happened, their impact, and what we can learn from them.

## Yahoo Data Breaches

The Yahoo data breaches refer to a series of cyber attacks against Yahoo that occurred between 2013 and 2014 and were not publicly disclosed until 2016. The attacks were among the largest data breaches in history, affecting all three billion Yahoo user accounts at the time.

The breaches exposed sensitive personal information, including names, email addresses, dates of birth, and security questions and answers.

The first breach occurred in 2013, when hackers gained access to Yahoo’s user database and stole data from all of the company’s user accounts. Although the breach was discovered in August 2013, Yahoo did not disclose it until December 2016.

The second breach occurred in 2014, when hackers accessed Yahoo’s systems through an employee’s account and stole data from 500 million accounts. In 2017, Yahoo agreed to a $350 million reduction in the sale price of its core business to Verizon due to the breaches and faced multiple lawsuits.

The US government accused Russian intelligence officers of being behind the attacks, though no individuals were arrested. Following the incidents, Yahoo required password resets, implemented two-factor authentication, hired a new Chief Information Security Officer, and invested in additional security measures. In 2017, Yahoo merged with AOL to form Oath, which was later acquired by Verizon.

## Equifax Data Breach

The Equifax data breach occurred in 2017 and affected the personal information of approximately 143 million Americans. Exposed data included names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and in some cases, driver’s license numbers.

The breach occurred when hackers exploited a known vulnerability in Equifax’s website software. Although a patch had been released, Equifax failed to apply it in time.

Equifax faced significant legal and financial consequences, including a $700 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and lawsuits from affected consumers. The breach was attributed to hackers believed to be associated with the Chinese military.

In response, Equifax offered free credit monitoring, hired a new Chief Information Security Officer, and invested in employee security training.

## WannaCry Ransomware Attack

The WannaCry ransomware attack occurred in May 2017, infecting over 200,000 computers across 150 countries. The malware encrypted victims’ files and demanded ransom payments for decryption.

The attack exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, believed to have been developed by the NSA and leaked by the Shadow Brokers.

The attack was attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking organization. Microsoft released emergency patches, and global cybersecurity efforts helped limit further damage. Despite expert warnings, some organizations chose to pay the ransom.

## Target Data Breach

The Target data breach occurred during the 2013 holiday shopping season and affected approximately 110 million customers. Compromised data included personal and payment card information.

Hackers gained access through a third-party vendor’s credentials and installed malware on Target’s payment systems. Target estimated $162 million in breach-related expenses.

The breach was attributed to hackers believed to be based in Russia. Target later adopted chip-and-PIN technology, improved vendor risk management, and expanded cybersecurity training.

## Stuxnet Worm

The Stuxnet worm was a highly sophisticated cyber weapon discovered in 2010 that targeted Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities.

It spread via infected USB drives and exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Siemens software. Stuxnet manipulated centrifuge operations, causing physical damage.

The worm was widely believed to be developed by the United States and Israel as part of Operation Olympic Games. Although Iran eventually recovered, the attack marked a turning point in cyber warfare.

## NotPetya Ransomware Attack

The NotPetya attack occurred in June 2017 and initially targeted Ukraine before spreading globally. It was delivered through a compromised update of the MeDoc accounting software.

The malware caused irreversible damage rather than enabling data recovery. Major companies affected included Maersk, Merck, and Reckitt Benckiser.

The attack has been attributed to the Russian military and is believed to have been part of a broader geopolitical campaign. Many organizations were forced to rebuild their systems from scratch.

## Sony Pictures Hack

The Sony Pictures hack occurred in November 2014 and was carried out by the “Guardians of Peace.”

The attack was allegedly in retaliation for the film *The Interview*, which depicted the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

The attack resulted in the theft of employee data, unreleased films, and confidential emails, causing significant reputational and financial damage. Sony later strengthened its internal security policies.

## Marriott Data Breach

The Marriott data breach was discovered in November 2018 and affected approximately 500 million customers through the Starwood reservation system.

Compromised data included personal information, passport numbers, and payment details. The breach caused major reputational damage and loss of customer trust.

Marriott notified affected customers, offered credit monitoring, and implemented stronger security controls.

## SolarWinds Hack

The SolarWinds supply chain attack was discovered in December 2020 and began as early as March of that year.

Attackers inserted a backdoor into updates for the Orion platform, impacting thousands of organizations, including US government agencies and major corporations.

The attack is believed to have been carried out by a Russian state-sponsored group. Mitigation efforts were complex due to the scale of the compromise.

## Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack

The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack occurred in May 2021 and disrupted nearly half of the East Coast’s fuel supply.

The DarkSide group used ransomware to encrypt systems, leading to a temporary shutdown and widespread fuel shortages. Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million ransom to regain control.

The incident prompted emergency government action and led to new cybersecurity regulations for critical infrastructure.

## Conclusion

By staying vigilant and proactive, we can better protect ourselves and our data from the ever-evolving threats of the digital age.
