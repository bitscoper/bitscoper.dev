title: "What Is Ray Tracing?"
---

Ray tracing is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to create photorealistic images by **simulating how light interacts with objects**.

## How Ray Tracing Works

1. **Ray Generation**  
   Rays (lines of sight) are generated from the viewer’s perspective for each pixel.

2. **Ray Intersection**  
   The renderer determines where these rays intersect with objects in the 3D scene.

3. **Light Propagation**  
   Light behavior is calculated as rays reflect, scatter, or are absorbed by surfaces.

4. **Color Calculation**  
   The final pixel color is computed based on the accumulated light information.

## Why Ray Tracing Looks Realistic

Ray tracing achieves high realism by accurately modeling:

- **Diffuse Reflection**: Light scattering off rough surfaces (e.g., walls).
- **Specular Reflection**: Mirror-like reflections from smooth surfaces.
- **Transparency and Refraction**: Light passing through materials such as glass.

Ray tracing is widely used in **films**, **video games**, and **architectural visualization** due to its ability to produce highly lifelike imagery.
