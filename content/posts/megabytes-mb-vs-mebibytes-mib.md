title: "Megabytes (MB) vs. Mebibytes (MiB)"
---

In computing, data measurement is often a source of confusion due to the coexistence of **decimal (base-10)** and **binary (base-2)** systems. While computers operate internally using binary logic, humans typically think in decimal terms, leading to widespread misunderstanding between **megabytes (MB)** and **mebibytes (MiB)**.

## Binary vs. Decimal Systems

- **Megabyte (MB)**: Defined by the International System of Units (SI), **1 MB equals 1,000,000 bytes**. This is a **decimal-based** unit and reflects the base-10 system commonly used in everyday measurement.

- **Mebibyte (MiB)**: Introduced by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1998 to standardize **binary-based units**, **1 MiB equals 1,048,576 bytes** (1024 × 1024, or 2²⁰ bytes). This unit more accurately aligns with how computers address memory.

## Why the Difference Matters

The discrepancy between MB and MiB becomes increasingly noticeable as storage sizes grow. For example, storage manufacturers often use decimal units, meaning a **500 GB** SSD contains **500,000,000,000 bytes**, which appears as approximately **465 GiB** when interpreted using binary units by operating systems.

This distinction also impacts network transfers, memory reporting, and system diagnostics, making it important to understand which unit is being used to accurately assess capacity and performance.
