title: "Classification of Crosstalk"
---

Crosstalk is a form of interference that occurs when signals traveling through twisted-pair cables interact with one another, causing disturbances in the intended (victim) signal.

## Based on Direction of Propagation

### Forward Crosstalk

Forward crosstalk propagates in the same direction as the signal causing the interference. It affects the victim signal as both signals travel together along the cable.

### Backward Crosstalk

Backward crosstalk propagates in the opposite direction of the interfering signal. This type of interference typically impacts the victim signal at the far end of the transmission path.

## Based on Site of Measurement

### Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT)

Near-End Crosstalk occurs at the source end of the cable, where the transmitted signal couples into the received signal, causing signal mixing and interference.

### Far-End Crosstalk (FEXT)

Far-End Crosstalk occurs at the destination end of the cable, where the transmitted signal interferes with the received signal at the far end of the link.

## Based on Quantification Method

### Power-Sum NEXT (PSNEXT)

PSNEXT measures the total crosstalk power at the near end caused by multiple interfering pairs within the same cable.

### Power-Sum FEXT (PSFEXT)

PSFEXT measures the combined far-end crosstalk power generated by multiple interfering pairs.

### Power-Sum Equal-Level FEXT (PS-ELFEXT)

PS-ELFEXT represents the power-sum far-end crosstalk normalized against signal attenuation, providing a more accurate measure of interference impact.

## Summary

This classification of crosstalk provides a clear framework for analyzing interference sources and selecting appropriate mitigation strategies in high-speed networking systems.
