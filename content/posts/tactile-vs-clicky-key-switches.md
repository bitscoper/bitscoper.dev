title: "Tactile vs. Clicky Key Switches"
---

Tactile and linear switches generally produce **similar, relatively subdued sound profiles**, whereas **clicky switches are designed to be noticeably louder**. The volume of a clicky switch depends on how forcefully the internal click mechanism engages, which introduces **variability** in perceived noise levels.

This variability can result in anything from a subtle click that is barely noticeable to a sharp, pronounced sound that dominates the typing experience. As a result, clicky switches are often perceived as noisier than they may be at full key travel, contributing to common misconceptions about the overall loudness of mechanical keyboards.

## Sound Profile Considerations

When choosing between tactile and clicky switches, the primary distinction lies in their **audio feedback**:

- **Tactile switches** provide a noticeable bump with a relatively muted sound, making them suitable for shared or professional environments.
- **Clicky switches** combine a tactile bump with an audible click, which can be disruptive in noise-sensitive spaces such as open-plan offices.

## Lubrication Considerations

Users who lubricate their switches should exercise caution with clicky models. Improper lubrication can dampen or distort the click mechanism, altering both sound and feel. In contrast, tactile switches are generally more forgiving when lubricated, as their feedback does not rely on an explicit click mechanism.
