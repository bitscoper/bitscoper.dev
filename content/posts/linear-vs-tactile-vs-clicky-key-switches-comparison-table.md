title: "Linear vs. Tactile vs. Clicky Key Switches: Comparison Table"
---

The table below compares **linear**, **tactile**, and **clicky** mechanical keyboard switches based on feel, sound, actuation force, and ideal use cases.

| Switch Type | Feel | Sound | Weight | Best Application |
|------------|------|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Linear** | Smooth and consistent from top to bottom | Near-silent | Light | Gaming |
| **Tactile** | Noticeable bump during the keystroke, typically near the top | Moderate | Medium | Typing |
| **Clicky** | Pronounced bump, typically mid-stroke | Loud click | Heavy | Typing (best when isolated from others) |
