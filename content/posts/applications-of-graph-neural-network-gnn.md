Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have a wide range of applications across diverse fields.

### Combinatorial Optimization

GNNs form the foundation of several optimization techniques. They are used for tasks such as determining shortest paths and identifying Eulerian circuits in graphs. In addition, GNNs can enhance human-designed algorithms by producing chip configurations that outperform manually created designs. They also improve expert-designed branch-and-bound methods by refining decision-making processes.

### Social Network Analysis

Because of their ability to model social graphs effectively, GNNs are widely used in recommendation systems. These systems consider both social connections and product attributes, enabling more accurate and personalized recommendations.

### Protein Folding

GNNs play a key role in *AlphaFold*, an AI system developed by Google’s *DeepMind* for predicting protein structures. This technology has consistently achieved outstanding results in multiple CASP competitions.

### Cybersecurity

By representing computer networks as graphs, GNNs can effectively detect anomalies. Malicious activities often appear as irregular patterns in provenance graphs. GNN-based models have been applied to detect such anomalies at multiple levels—nodes, paths, and edges—providing comprehensive detection of malicious behavior.

### Water Distribution Networks

Water supply systems can be naturally modeled as graphs, making GNNs well suited for their analysis. These models are used to forecast water demand by integrating data from multiple District Metered Areas, improving prediction accuracy. GNNs also support the creation of metamodels that enhance modeling efficiency and provide clearer insights into complex systems.

Each of these applications demonstrates how GNNs leverage graph-structured data to solve complex problems across multiple domains.
